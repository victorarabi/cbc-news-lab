**Data Source:**

[https://canopy.cbc.ca/live/elections/prov/ON2025/all](https://canopy.cbc.ca/live/elections/prov/ON2025/all)

**Task:**

Create a solution that displays:

- **(Priority 1)** The top 3 parties (hint: check data.parties and use the 'displayOrder' property for sorting).
- **(Priority 2)** Close races (hint: check the ‘data.extras’ property).

You can use the [Ontario 2025](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/ontario/2025/results/) results page as inspiration

**Guidelines:**

- For each display, use your best judgement as to what data points to display.
- Bonus points awarded for creativity and utilizing things like party colours.
- Your solution should build / compile successfully.
- Your code should be written in TypeScript.
- You may install additional npm modules - ensure they're listed in `package.json`.

**Submission:**

- If using CodeSandbox: Use the "Download Devbox" option (square icon menu option), and submit this.
- If using local development environment: Save your solution as a .zip file & upload it (please exclude any `node_modules` or `dist` directories).

**Happy coding!**
